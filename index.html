    </header>
    <main>
        <br><p class="col-12">¡Hola Swifties! Si les gusta tocar el ukelele y quieren aprender algunas de las mejores canciones de TS, están en el sitio adecuado. ¡Y muchas de ellas son de la setlist de The Eras Tour! Entonces, si no conseguiste boletos (lloremos juntos) con mayor razón quédate para que de perdido las escuches homemade.<p>
        <h3>Antes de comenzar:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Asegúrate de tener bien afinado tu uke. Personalmente me gusta usar la app de GuitarTuna.</li>
            <li>Despreocúpate, porque no vamos a usar capotraste.</li>
            <li>Puedes consultar cómo se toca cada acorde <a href="https://youtu.be/BlHLz0CtECA" target="_blank">aquí</a></li>
            <li>Por cuestiones de derechos de autor, algunos videos no se pueden reproducir aquí, pero pueden ir a ellos haciendo clic.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Espero disfruten mucho esta compilación que hice con mucho amor uwu.</p>

            Put those Georgia stars to shame that night<br>
            I said, "That's a lie"<br>
            Just a boy in a Chevy truck<br>
            That had a tendency of gettin' stuck<br>
            On backroads at night<br>
            And I was right there beside him all summer long<br>
            And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone<br>
            <br><br>
            But when you think Tim McGraw<br>
            I hope you think my favorite song<br>
            The one we danced to all night long<br>
            The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
            When you think happiness<br>
            I hope you think that little black dress<br>
            Think of my head on your chest<br>
            And my old faded blue jeans<br>
            When you think Tim McGraw<br>

            <br><br>
            September saw a month of tears<br>
            And thanking God that you weren't here<br>
            To see me like that<br>
            But in a box beneath my bed<br>
            Is a letter that you never read<br>
            From three summers back<br>
            It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet<br>
            And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe<br>
            <br><br>
            When you think Tim McGraw<br>
            I hope you think my favorite song<br>
            The one we danced to all night long<br>
            The moon like a spotlight on the lake<br>
            When you think happiness<br>

            Think of my head on your chest<br>
            And my old faded blue jeans<br>
            When you think Tim McGraw<br>
            I hope you think of me<br>
            <br><br>
            And I'm back for the first time since then<br>
            I'm standing on your street<br>
            And there's a letter left on your doorstep<br>
            And the first thing that you'll read<br>
            <br><br>
            Is when you think Tim McGraw<br>
            I hope you think my favorite song<br>
            Someday you'll turn your radio on<br>
            I hope it takes you back to that place<br>
            When you think happiness<br>
            I hope you think that little black dress<br>
            Think of my head on your chest<br>
            And my old faded blue jeans<br>
            When you think Tim McGraw<br>
            I hope you think of me<br>

            <br><p>We were both young when I first saw you<br>
                I close my eyes and the flashback starts<br>
                I'm standing there<br>
                On a balcony in summer air<br><br>

                See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns<br>
                See you make your way through the crowd<br>
                And say "Hello"<br>
                Little did I know<br><br>

                That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles<br>
                And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
                And I was crying on the staircase<br>
                Begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
                And I said<br><br>

                "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
                I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
                You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess<br>
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br><br>

                So I sneak out to the garden to see you<br>
                We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew<br>
                So close your eyes<br>
                Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh<br><br>

                'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter<br>
                And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"<br>
                But you were everything to me<br>
                I was begging you, "Please don't go"<br>
                And I said<br><br>

                "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone<br>
                I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run<br>
                You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess<br>
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br><br>

                Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel<br>
                This love is difficult, but it's real<br>
                Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess<br>
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes<br>
                Oh, oh-oh<br><br>

                I got tired of waiting<br>
                Wondering if you were ever coming around<br>
                My faith in you was fading<br>
                When I met you on the outskirts of town<br>
                And I said<br><br>

                "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone<br>
                I keep waiting for you, but you never come<br>
                Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"<br>
                He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring<br>
                And said<br><br>

                "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone<br>
                I love you, and that's all I really know<br>
                I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress<br>
                It's a love story, baby, just say yes"<br><br>

                Oh, oh-oh<br>
                Oh, oh-oh, oh<br>
                'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

                I sneak in and see your friends<br>
                And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel<br>
                And she is yelling at a bridesmaid<br>
                Somewhere back inside a room<br>
                Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry<br><br>

                This is surely not what you thought it would be<br>

                Don't say yes, run away now<br>

                You need to hear me out<br>
                And they said, "Speak now"<br><br>

                Fond gestures are exchanged<br>
                And the organ starts to play<br>
                A song that sounds like a death march<br>
                And I am hiding in the curtains<br>
                It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be<br><br>

                She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen<br>
                But I know you wish it was me<br>
                You wish it was me<br>
                Don't you?<br><br>

                Don't say yes, run away now<br>
                I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door<br>

                You need to hear me out<br>

                I'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door<br>
                Don't wait, or say a single vow<br>
                Your time is running out<br>
                And they said, "Speak now"<br><br>

                I hear the preacher say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace"<br>
                There's the silence, there's my last chance<br>
                I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me<br>
                Horrified looks from everyone in the room<br>
                But I'm only looking at you<br><br>

                I am not the kind of girl<br>
                Who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion<br>

                Don't wait, or say a single vow<br>
                You need to hear me out<br>
                And they said, "Speak now"<br>
                And you'll say, "Let's run away now"<br>
                I'll meet you when I'm out of my tux at the back door<br>
                Baby, I didn't say my vows<br>

            Talk to my friends, talk to me<br>

            Getting back together<br><br>

            Like, ever!<br><br>

            I'm really gonna miss you picking fights, and me<br>
            Falling for it, screaming that I'm right, and you<br>
            Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some<br>
            Indie record that’s much cooler than mine<br>

            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>
            You called me up again tonight, but<br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh<br>

            I used to think that we were forever, ever<br>
            And I used to say: Never say never<br><br>

            Ugh, so he calls me up and he’s like: I still love you<br>
            And I'm like, I'm just<br>
            Yeah, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?<br>
            Like, we are never getting back together<br>
            Like, ever!<br>
            No<br><br>

            Ah-ah, ah-ah<br>
            It feels like a perfect night<br>
            For breakfast at midnight<br>
            To fall in love with strangers<br>
            Ah-ah, ah-ah<br><br>

            Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time<br>

            This place is too crowded<br>
            Too many cool kids<br>

            I brought a knife to a gunfight<br>
            They took the crown, but it's alright<br>
            All the liars are calling me one<br>
            Nobody's heard from me for months<br>
            I'm doing better than I ever was<br><br>

            And I know I make the same mistakes every time<br>
            Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right<br>
            I did one thing right<br>
            I'm laughin' with my lover, makin' forts under covers<br>
            Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right<br>

            On a chain 'round my neck, chain 'round my neck<br>
            Not because he owns me<br>
            But 'cause he really knows me<br>
            Which is more than they can say, I<br>
            I recall late November<br>
            Holdin' my breath, slowly I said<br>
            "You don't need to save me<br>
            But would you run away with me?"<br>
            Yes (would you run away?)<br><br>

            This is our place, we make the rules <br>
            And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear <br>
            Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?<br><br>
            
            Can I go where you go? <br>
            Can we always be this close, forever and ever? <br>

            I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br><br>
    
            Ladies and gentlemen, will you, please, stand? <br>
            With every guitar string scar on my hand <br>
            I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover <br>
            My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue <br>
            All's well that ends well to end up with you <br>
            Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover <br>
            And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me <br>
            And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover<br><br>

            Where I used to read at Centennial Park<br>
            I used to think I would meet somebody there<br>
            Teal was the color of your shirt<br>
            When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop<br>
            You used to work at to make a little money<br><br>

            Time, curious time<br>
            Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs<br>
            Were there clues I didn't see?<br>
            And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
            All along there was some<br>
            Invisible string<br>
            Tying you to me?<br>
            Ooh<br><br>

            Bad was the blood of the song in the cab<br>
            On your first trip to LA<br>
            You ate at my favorite spot for dinner<br>
            Bold was the waitress on our three year trip<br>
            Getting lunch down by the lakes<br>
            She said I looked like an American singer<br><br>

            Time, mystical time<br>
            Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine<br>
            Were there clues I didn't see?<br>

            Tying you to me?<br>
            Ooh<br><br>

            A string that pulled me<br>
            Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar<br>
            Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire<br>
            Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons<br>
            One single thread of gold tied me to you<br>

            Cold was the steel of my axe to grind<br>
            For the boys who broke my heart<br>
            Now I send their babies presents<br>
            Gold was the color of the leaves<br>
            When I showed you around Centennial Park<br>
            Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven<br><br>

            Time, wondrous time<br>
            Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies<br>
            And it's cool, baby, with me<br>
            And isn't it just so pretty to think<br>
            All along there was some<br>
            Invisible string<br>
            Tying you to me?<br>

            <br><p>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night<br>
            Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife<br>
            And if it was an open-shut case<br>
            I never would've known from that look on your face<br>
            Lost in your current like a priceless wine<br>
            The more that you say<br>
            The less I know<br>
            Wherever you stray<br>
            I follow<br>
            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
            Wreck my plans<br>
            That's my man<br><br>

            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
            Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in<br>
            As if you were a mythical thing<br>
            Like you were a trophy or a champion ring<br>
            And there was one prize I'd cheat to win<br>
            The more that you say<br>
            The less I know<br>
            Wherever you stray<br>
            I follow<br>
            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
            Wreck my plans<br>
            That's my man<br>
            You know that my train could take you home<br>
            Anywhere else is hollow<br>
            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>
            Wreck my plans<br>
            That's my man<br><br>

            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
            They count me out time and time again<br>
            Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)<br>
            But I come back stronger than a 90's trend<br><br>

            Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark<br>
            Show me the places where the others gave you scars<br>
            Now this is an open-shut case<br>
            Guess I should've known from the look on your face<br>
            Every bait and switch was a work of art<br><br>

            The more that you say<br>
            The less I know<br>
            Wherever you stray<br>
            I follow<br>
            I'm begging for you to take my hand<br>

                    I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser <br>
                    Midnights become my afternoons<br>
                    When my depression works the graveyard shift<br>
                    All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room<br><br>

                    I should not be left to my own devices<br>
                    They come with prices and <br>
                    I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)<br>
                    I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
                    One day I'll watch as you're leaving <br>
                    'Cause you got tired of my scheming <br>
                    (For the last time) <br><br>

                    It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me <br>
                    At tea time, everybody agrees<br>
                    I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
                    It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero <br<br>

                    Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby <br>
                    And I'm a monster on the hill<br>
                    Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city<br>
                    Pierced through the heart, but never <br><br>
                    
                    Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism<br>
                    Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)<br>
                    I wake up screaming from dreaming<br>
                    One day I'll watch as you're leaving<br>
                    And life will lose all its meaning<br>
                    (For the last time)<br><br>

                    It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
                    At tea time, everybody agrees<br>
                    I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
                    It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero<br><br>

                    I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money<br>
                    She thinks I left them in the will<br>
                    The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out<br>
                    "She's laughing up at us from hell"<br><br>

                    It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
                    It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me<br>
                    It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees<br><br>

                    It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)<br>
                    At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)<br>
                    I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror<br>
                    It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
